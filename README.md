# batch_queue2

**batch_queue2** is a simple task queuing system built using Python's `asyncio`. It allows you to submit, manage, and track tasks using a lightweight, XML-RPC-based interface.

## Features
- Submit, list, suspend, resume, and kill tasks using command-line commands.
- Tasks can be queued, paused, or resumed based on available CPUs.
- XML-RPC server for managing task requests.
- Ability to run tasks using multiple CPUs.
- Tasks can be paused and resumed.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- `aiohttp`
- `requests`

## Installation
You can install **batch_queue2** from PyPI:

```sh
pip install batch_queue2
```

Or clone the repository from [Sourcehut](https://sr.ht/~ndbecker2/batch_queue2/):

```sh
git clone https://sr.ht/~ndbecker2/batch_queue2/
cd batch_queue2
python -m pip install .
```

## Usage

After installing, you can use the `batch_queue` command to manage tasks. Below are the available options:

### Starting the Server
To start the server:

```sh
batch_queue start --max-cpus 4
```

- `--max-cpus`: (Optional) Specify the maximum number of CPUs to use. Defaults to the number of CPUs available on your system.

The server will start in daemon mode by default.

### Submitting a Task
To submit a task, use the `submit` command:

```sh
batch_queue submit <command>
```
For example:

```sh
batch_queue submit sleep 10
```

You can also optionally specify:
- `--log-stdout <file>`: Redirect the standard output of the task to a file.
- `--log-stderr <file>`: Redirect the standard error of the task to a file.

### Listing Tasks
To list all tasks:

```sh
batch_queue list
```
This will display:
- Max CPUs available.
- Active tasks.
- Queued tasks.
- Paused tasks.

### Suspending and Resuming Tasks
To suspend a running task:

```sh
batch_queue suspend <task_id>
```

To resume a paused task:

```sh
batch_queue resume <task_id>
```

### Killing a Task
To kill a specific task:

```sh
batch_queue kill <task_id>
```
You can also optionally specify the signal to use, default is `SIGTERM`.

### Getting Task Information
To get detailed information about a specific task:

```sh
batch_queue id <task_id>
```
This command provides detailed information about the task including command, user, working directory, environment variables, and logs.

### Stopping the Server
To stop the server:

```sh
batch_queue stop
```
This command gracefully stops the server, ensuring no tasks are left in a zombie state.

## Example Workflow
1. Start the server using:
   ```sh
   batch_queue start --max-cpus 4
   ```

2. Submit a couple of tasks:
   ```sh
   batch_queue submit sleep 10
   batch_queue submit echo "Hello World"
   ```

3. List the tasks to see the active, queued, and paused tasks:
   ```sh
   batch_queue list
   ```

4. Suspend a running task:
   ```sh
   batch_queue suspend 0
   ```

5. Resume a paused task:
   ```sh
   batch_queue resume 0
   ```

6. Stop the server:
   ```sh
   batch_queue stop
   ```

## Logging
The server logs all activity to `~/batch_queue.log`. You can view the log to monitor task submissions, task status changes, server starts and stops, etc.
